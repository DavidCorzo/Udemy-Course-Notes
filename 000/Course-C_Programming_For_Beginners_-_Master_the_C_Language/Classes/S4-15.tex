\subsection{Comments}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The comments are a way of documenting a program, increasing readibility.
    \item They remind you or someone else what the code is doing.
    \item Comments are ignored by the compiler.
    \item A comment can save significant amount of time, it can make the program readible in the sense that everyone who wants to understand.
    \item To write a comment:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item ``/*'' marks the beggining of a multiple line comment, to close you use ``*/''
            \item The single line comment can be done with the ``//''. 
        \end{itemize}
    \item Don't use comments in excess.
    \item Add the comments while you are doing the code, it's easier.
    \item Comments help when there are errors.
    \item Meaningful names are a form of documentation.
    \item See: \textbf{Clean Code}.
\end{itemize}
