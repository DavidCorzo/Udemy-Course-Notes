    \item How to delete entries when they have foreign keys linked to them.
    \item ON DELETE SET NULL is basically when we delete an employee all foreign associated to that employee is going to be set to null.
    \item ON CASCADE is basically when we delete an employee the rows in other tables containing employee ids pointing to the deleted employee are also going to get eliminated.
    \item The code below signifies that if the employee id in the employee table gets deleted the value of that foreign key is set to null. 
        \begin{minted}[autogobble]{sql}
            CREATE TABLE branch (
                branch_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                branch_name VARCHAR(40),
                mgr_id INT,
                mgr_start_date DATE,
                FOREIGN KEY(mgr_id) REFERENCES employee(emp_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
            );
        \end{minted}
    
    \item You might want to consider using set null when the attribute being deleted is no essential, if it is essential then use cascade.
