\begin{itemize}
    \item A trigger is basically is a block of SQL code that will define what needs to happen when a certain operation gets performed on a database.
    
    \item Making a trigger needs to be done from the command line.
        \begin{minted}[autogobble]{sql}
            DELIMITER $$ 
                CREATE 
                    TRIGGER my_trigger BEFORE INSERT 
                    ON employee
                    FOR EACH ROW BEGIN 
                        INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('added new people');
                    END$$
                DELIMITER ;
        \end{minted}
    
    \item Example:
        \begin{minted}[autogobble]{sql}
            DELIMITERDELIMITER $$ 
                CREATE TRIGGER my_trigger2 BEFORE INSERT 
                ON employee 
                FOR EACH ROW BEGIN 
                    IF NEW.sex = 'M' THEN 
                        INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('added male employee');
                    ELSEIF NEW.sex = 'F' THEN 
                        INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('added female');
                    ELSE 
                        INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('added other employee');
                    END IF;
                END$$
            DELIMITER ;
        \end{minted}
    
    \item Use \mintinline{sql}{drop trigger} command to eliminate the trigger.
