\begin{itemize}
    \item Ways of grabbing data that matches a specific pattern.
    \item Find any client's who are an LLC:
        \begin{minted}[autogobble]{sql}
            SELECT * FROM client WHERE client_name LIKE '%LLC';
        \end{minted}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The condition will be true if the last three characters of the client name are LLC, the \% wildcard allows you to not specify from which character index you must start.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item Use characters to define a 'template' for pattern matching.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \% means any number of characters.
            \item \_ means one character.
        \end{itemize}
