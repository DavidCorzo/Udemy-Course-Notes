\subsection{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It's part of the compiliation fase, it does things before compiling, basically doing stuff before compiling.
    \item The include is an example of a preprocesor command or directive; the preprocessors statements begin with a pound sign as first character in teh line, ``\# include <stdio.h>''.
    \item Preprocessor usage:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Create your constants and macros with the \#define statement.
            \item Include library files use the \#include statement.
            \item More powerful programs with the conditional \ifdef, \#endif, \#else, \#ifndef statements.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item This all happens before compiliation.
\end{itemize}
