\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Another comparison based sorting algorithm.
    \item Worst case complexity of $O(n\log_{}\p{ n } )$. 
    \item The space complexity of heap sort is contant $O(1)$.
    \item Heap sort is a improved version of selection sort that uses the heap data structure.
    \item Consists of: Build a heap with the unsorted data, then delete the elements from unsorted, and order them in another heap.
\end{itemize}

\section{Almost complete binary}
A binary tree in which nodes can only me added from left to right. 


\section{Representing an almost complete binary tree as an array}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For any parent $i$ the children are: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Left: $2i$ 
            \item Right: $2i+1$ 
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item For any child node $k$, the parent is $\left\lfloor k/2 \right\rfloor$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Formal definition of heap}
Maxheap:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The largest value is stored in the root.
\end{itemize}
Minheap: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The smallest value is stored in the root.
\end{itemize}
